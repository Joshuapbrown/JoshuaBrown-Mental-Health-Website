      <em>Being aware of your overall health is <strong>important</strong></em>
      so that you can detect any symptoms and seek professional help when necessary. While everyone is familiar familiar with the symptoms and treatment options for common illnesses that affect their loved ones, like the flu, migraines, or and (most recently) COVID-19, many people are unsure how to look after their mental health.

      Raising mental health awareness can help you to understand your symptoms, find professional treatment, and, perhaps most importantly, break the mental health stigma that leaves so many people suffering in secret.
      Mental health is the balanced development of the individual’s personality and emotional attitudes which enable him to live harmoniously with his fellow men.

    In 1959 W.H.O. Expert Committee on mental health review­ed the various definitions of mental health and observed that mental health is influenced by both-biological and social factors It is not a static condition but subject to variations and fluctuations in degree, It is the capacity in an indivi­dual to form harmonious relations with others and to contribute constructively to changes in his-social and physical environment. ‘

    However, mental health of the children is much more important than that of the physical health mental fitness makes children more useful person in the world and also equipped physically, socially and morally.</p>
